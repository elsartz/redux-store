  # Installation
    A full working e-commerce platform that uses:
   - IndexedDB for offline storage, 
   - MongoDB Atlas as a cloud storage and it is deployed on 
   - [Heroku](https://still-journey-63976.herokuapp.com/) a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS).
    

  # Usage
    AS a software engineer working on an e-commerce platform,
    I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API,
    SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.
